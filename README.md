# Homer

Homer is a [statsd](https://github.com/etsy/statsd)-compatible stats
aggregator written in Rust. I'm basing this implementation on github's statsd
implementation [brubeck](https://github.com/github/brubeck).

## Why

To write something in Rust. I've been reading statsd related code lately,
especially a C-implementation, and I'd like to see whether I can make it
shorter and easier to understand for my usecase.
